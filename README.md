The Pac-Man game is a classic arcade game that has been recreated using Python programming language. This Python version of Pac-Man retains the original gameplay mechanics and visual elements while providing a modern twist with its implementation in a programming environment.

Key Features:

1. Classic Gameplay: The Python Pac-Man game faithfully recreates the classic gameplay of the original arcade game. Players control Pac-Man, navigating through a maze while avoiding ghosts and collecting pellets.

2. Maze Design: The game features maze layouts similar to the original Pac-Man game, with twists and turns that challenge players' navigation skills. The maze design adds complexity to the gameplay and keeps players engaged.

3. Ghosts AI: The ghosts in the game are controlled by artificial intelligence algorithms that dictate their movement patterns. These AI-driven ghosts pursue Pac-Man throughout the maze, creating obstacles and adding an element of challenge to the game.

4. Power-ups: Just like in the original game, players can collect power pellets that temporarily empower Pac-Man to turn the tables on the ghosts. When Pac-Man consumes a power pellet, the ghosts turn blue, and players can eat them for extra points.

5. Scoreboard: The game keeps track of players' scores as they collect pellets and eat ghosts. A scoreboard displays the current score, allowing players to compete with themselves or others for high scores.

6. Sound Effects: To enhance the gaming experience, the Python Pac-Man game includes sound effects that mimic those of the original arcade game. These sound effects add nostalgia and immersion to the gameplay.

7. User Controls: Players can control Pac-Man using keyboard inputs, allowing them to navigate through the maze with ease. The intuitive controls make the game accessible to players of all skill levels.
